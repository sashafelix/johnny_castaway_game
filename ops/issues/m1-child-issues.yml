    body:
      what: Create the GameRoot scene and a minimal boot flow that can start a run from MainMenu.
      why: We need a stable entry point for every play session; everything else hangs off this.
      definition_of_done:
        - GameRoot scene exists and loads without errors
        - MainMenu can start a new run
        - No duplicate managers on reload
        - Basic logging for boot steps
      system: Sim
      priority: P1
      notes: Keep it minimal; DevHUD is fine for now.

      why: Prevents lifecycle spaghetti and makes save/load/pause deterministic.
      definition_of_done:
        - 'States exist: Boot, Running, Paused, GameOver/Won'
        - Transitions are event-driven (no hidden side effects)
        - State is visible in DevHUD/logs
        - No regressions on scene reload
